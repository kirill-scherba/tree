# Tree

Golang package tree is pure golang implementation of tree with any direction nodes. Each node in the tree can be connected to many children and has many parents.

![Multinode tree](mchtree.png "Multinode tree")

In the implementation of this tree, parents are no different from children. The tree element contains references to branches without specifying whether it is a parent or a child.

Each node reference in an element contains a path cost that is taken into account when calculating the path from point A to point B. The path between points A and B calculates using threads (parallel) to minimize time of find all paths.

This tree has no root. Paths in a tree can be looped.

The tree elements can store any data structure. This structure is defined when the tree is created.

## How to install it

The reference implementation in this repo is written in Go. To use tree
in a Go program, install the code using this command: `go get -u github.com/kirill-scherba/tree`.

## How to use it

There is basic example `./examples/simple/` which use basic tree functions. You can execute it locally:

```bash
go run ./examples/simple/
```

or run it directly from github:

```bash
go run github.com/kirill-scherba/tree/examples/simple@latest
```

This sample creates tree. And some elements, set path between elements. Print the tree and calculate path between elements.

```bash
Print tree example:

. My first element
â”œâ”€â”€ My first child, cost: 1.00
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ My first element, cost: 1.00 ðŸ¡¡
